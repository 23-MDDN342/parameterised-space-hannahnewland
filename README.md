### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space


My idea for this design mimics a snake pit; snakes slithering over and over each other repeatedly. I made my very rough sketch on illustrator, but in the actual code I plan to have the heads of the snakes as well, so it's more obvious what is actually happening.

I added the code from https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2058264 as a starting point/reference for how to begin my grids and my overall code. I will work away from this.
