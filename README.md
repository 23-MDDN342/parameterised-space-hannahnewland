### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space


My idea for this design mimics a snake pit; snakes slithering over and over each other repeatedly. I made my very rough sketch on illustrator, but in the actual code I plan to have the heads of the snakes as well, so it's more obvious what is actually happening.
